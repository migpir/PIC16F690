# PIC16F690
Repository for PIC16F690 projects
This repository contains projects that describe the various features on the PIC16F690 microncontoller.  It will contain circuit diagrams, design equations, rationale and asssembly or C code to demo the project.

This is my personal reference repository for how to use the PIC16F690 microcontroller.
